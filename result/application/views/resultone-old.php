				<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
				<p >Why? Because there&#39;s only so much we can cover here on my website ...</p>
				<p >And sometimes, you need to talk to a real human being!</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="subtitle notop">Would You Like To Talk To A Live Reader For Free?</span></p>
				<p ><?php echo $name; ?>, online readings can be fast, easy, and profound...</p>
				<p >But they are limited.</p>
				<p >A real live tarot reader can cover nuances of the cards and make your reading even more accurate - even in just five minutes.</p>
				<p >The problem? Most psychics cost a FORTUNE!</p>
				<p >I mean, you&#39;ve seen psychics online charging $10... $20... even up to $70 or $80 per MINUTE, right?</p>
				<p >Doesn&#39;t that seem a little CRAZY?</p>
				<p >That&#39;s more expensive than seeing a psychologist!</p>
				<p>And a little unrealistic for just a regular person to get some simple, intuitive help.</p>
				<p>Sometimes, you just need a little signal from the Universe to guide you in life and prepare you for what&#39;s to come ... just like watching the news, or checking the weather report.</p> 
				<p>But you don&#34;t want to pay an arm and a leg!</p> 
				<p>Well, imagine this...</p>
				<p>What if it WAS possible to access real live psychics on a regular basis for a fraction of the standard price?</p>
				<p>What if you could check in with them weekly, interact with them personally, and even send in a written question to get a reply back because you&#39;re part of the same community?</p>
				<p>What if you had an entire TEAM of gifted friends and spiritual advisors helping you peel back the curtains on your life and get the answers you need so you take right action with confidence?</p>
				<p>Wouldn&#34;t that make life so much easier?</p>
				<p>Well ... guess what? 
				<p>It IS possible, and it&#39;s not just a dream anymore.</p> 
				<p>Because here&#39;s the good news:</p> 
				<p>Now you can access a secret community of psychics, mystics, and spiritual practitioners, that can help guide you along for two whole weeks...</p> 
				<p>... for FREE!</p> 
				<p>Just cover the $1 processing fee to register, and you&#39;ll get $96 in amazing bonuses for free, just for giving it a try. Plus, you can cancel any time and pay nothing.</p>

				<p>Now, you&#39;re probably wondering...</p> 
				<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="subtitle notop">Who Am I And Why Should You Listen To Me?</span></p>
				<p>My name is Crystal Aryana, and when I was a little girl, I would spend hours and hours praying to God to bless me with a normal life.</p> 
				<p>You see, ever since I could remember, I would receive these strange messages that would appear in my mind and roll right off of my tongue.</p> 
				<p>The thing is, I had no idea where they came from.</p> 
				<p>But they were always true...</p> 
				<p>And this one time, they scared my mother half to death!</p> 
				<p>I was about 7 years old when it happened.</p> 
				<p>Mom was sitting across the dusky room in her grandmother&#39;s old rocking chair.</p> 
				<p>She was always into &#34;new age&#34; thinking, my Mom. She believed there was more to this world than the &#34;third dimension&#34; life we all feel trapped in.</p> 
				<p>In fact, she was so open minded that she used to draw Tarot cards on our kitchen table, whenever she felt unsure about something in her life, and would teach me every step of the way.</p> 
				<p>But THIS one thing was just WAY too much for her...</p>
				<p>Here&#34;s why:</p>
				<p>As she sat there rocking, she reached over to hand me this cute little hand-woven handkerchief with doodles and a bee inside a honey pot stitched into the side.</p> 
				<p>I had never seen it before, but when I felt the cloth in my hand, something took over.</p>
				<p>&#34;That angry old man&#34; I said</p>
				<p>The words didn&#39;t make sense to me...</p>
				<p>But they made perfect sense to my Mom.</p> 
				<p>&#34;WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?&#34; she scratched, her face as white as a ghost.</p> 
				<p>I didn&#34;t know what to say.</p> 
				<p>What I didn&#39;t know back then, that Nana - my mother&#39;s grandmother - was knitting that handkerchief alone in a room with my mother when she was about 8 years old.</p>
				<p>The plan was that Nana would knit it for my Mom, and she&#39;d give it to her Dad.</p> 
				<p>And guess what? As Nana sat there knitting this handkerchief for her son, she was laughing at how mad he would get.</p> 
				<p>She even gave him a new nickname</p>
				<p>&#34;Angry Old Man&#34;</p>
				<p>My Mom was FLOORED when those words came out of my mouth. Especially when it happened the moment I touched her father&#39;s handkerchief.</p>
				<p>I don&#34;t remember much else after that, but she never looked at me the same.</p>
				<p>She said I was a &#34;psychic&#34; ... and I denied it for a while, as to not freak her out. I even stopped reading tarot cards with her.</p> 
				<p>But after enough freakish experiences, and encounters I can&#39;t even explain, I set out on a life long quest to find out exactly what that means.</p> 
				<p>Little did I know, my mother had sent me down a path to...</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="subtitle notop">Take Right Action And Get Ongoing Guidance In Life</span></p>
				<p>Fast forward to today...</p>
				<p>I&#39;ve traveled the world seeking deeper truths to life, working with teachers like...</p>
				<p>Chakra Healer Barbara Brennan, who taught me how to balance my chakra system so I can live a happier life...</p>
				<p>Energy healer Dr. Kam Yuen who taught me how to heal other people almost instantly through Chinese Energetic Medicine...</p>
				<p>Reiki Master Diane Stein who certified me as a Reiki Master lvl 3 and heal people across the globe...</p>
				<p>Zen Master Adyashanti who taught me the power of stillness during a series of 7 day silence retreats...</p>
				<p>NLP institute where I got certified in transformational psychology and using language to change patterns and beliefs holding you back... </p>
				<p>And even three years of Landmark Forums, to pull it all together in the &#34;real world&#34; using practical psychology and ways to apply spiritual tools to succeed.</p> 
				<p>But, my heart was always with my mother who showed me Tarot cards when I was a little girl, even though my gifts scared her half to death, so I combined all my knowledge and sought others who did the same.</p> 
				<p>Since then, I&#39;ve helped hundreds of people connect with their own spiritual nature using a variety of practices, from tarot cards, astrology, numerology, and angel divination...</p>
				<p>...to meditations, motivational speaking, yoga, practical psychology and more.</p> 
				<p>My website gets thousands of hits a day, with over 77,535 men and women having taken the same three card reading you just did - sometimes every single day.</p> 
				<p>I&#39;m truly blessed to have found this path of spiritual awakening, but I couldn&#39;t have done it without the mentors, guides, and experts who helped me along the way.</p>
				<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m so excited to give you the same opportunity I had...</p>
				<p>An opportunity to reconnect with your spiritual nature through the same set of tools.</p> 
				<p>And that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ll find as a member of The Secret Inner Circle.</p>

				<p>Then, if you want to stay, it&#39;s only $67 per month after that.</p>				 
				<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="subtitle notop">Why It&#39;s Just $1 For 14 Days Of Inner Circle Access</span></p>	
				<p>There are three reasons why we charge $1 to register, and not for free:</p>
				<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left:100px;">
						<li style="margin-bottom:20px;">We need to verify your identity. Our readers are real people, and we need to make sure that you are a real person, and not some scammer with a stolen credit card. We take everyone&#39;s privacy very seriously! By charging $1 we can at least know that you are who you say you are, and we&#39;re comfortable letting you inside our community.</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom:20px;">It only costs $1, which means that anyone in the world can afford to get real answers from real spiritual advisors, even if it&#39;s only for two weeks. I&#39;m sure you agree that everyone deserves a chance to connect with the Universe, and that money shouldn&#39;t have to stand in your way.</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom:20px;">If you&#39;re not willing to spend $1 to get even one question answered by a real human being who spends their time and energy on you, let alone two weeks of live group readings for that same dollar, then you&#39;re not the kind of person we want in our community to begin with. A single dollar does a great job to weed out low-vibration people who stand there with their hand out. But you&#39;re not like that NAME…</li> 
				</ol>
				<p>Above all, we know after two weeks of spiritual guidance inside your new community, you&#39;ll agree $67 a month is an absolute steal for this level of support, and you&#39;ll want to stay.</p>
				<p>And, if two full weeks of real time with real people wasn&#39;t enough to get you racing to the registration page, then I have something even MORE valuable for you.</p>

				<p>These are worth $96, but are my gift to you, just for giving the Secret Inner Circle an honest try.</p>
				<p>THAT is how confident I am that you&#39;ll absolutely love being a member of our tribe <3</p>
				<p>Are you ready to get the spiritual support you deserve?</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="subtitle notop">Join The Secret Inner Circle For Just $1!</span></p>
				<p>Here&#39;s what I want you to do next:</p>
				<p>Click the button below to access our registration page, hosted by our good friends at Clickbank.com, who will verify your identity by charging $1 to your credit card, or paypal account through their private, safe and secure shopping cart system.</p> 
				<p>After paying a buck, you’ll get instant access to download your free gifts and a secret link to find our facebook group (along with non-facebook streaming instructions that take two seconds).</p>  
				<p>If you&#39;re on Facebook, you&#39;ll apply for the group with the same email that you used to register, and we’ll approve you right away. If not, you’ll get your direct links in email.</p>  
				<p>The moment you join, you&#39;ll jump into whatever live stream might be happening, and browse the event schedule to see what live readings are right for you.</p>  
				<p>You&#39;ll spend two full weeks enjoying the wisdom and insights of your new family, connecting with like-minded people, and awakening your own spiritual gifts inside this awesome and thriving community.</p>  
				<p>And you can do it all, for the four quarters you could probably find in your couch right now.</p> 
				<p style="text-align:center; text-decoration:underline;"><span class="subtitle notop">Sign Up Now, Risk Nothing And Cancel Any Time</span></p>
				<p>Look, I know that the Secret Inner Circle isn&#39;t for anyone, which is why I&#39;m taking all the risk off your already too-heavy-shoulders.</p>
				<p>That&#39;s why we make it so easy to cancel your trial subscription, no hassle - no questions asked!</p>
				<p>Join The Inner Circle, and if for whatever reason you feel like it’s not your cup of tea, then you can simply cancel over the next 14 days and you&#39;ll never be charged again.</p>   
				<p>Or, stay for a month or two, then cancel after that.</p>  
				<p>You can cancel any time!</p>
				<p>Just write us a quick email and our sweet and friendly customer support team will cancel your account that same day.</p>
				<p>This way, you have nothing to risk and everything to gain. Just by giving our private community the chance to change your life.</p>  
				<p>Could it be any easier to get started?</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="subtitle notop">Don&#39;t Delay, This $1 Offer Won&#39;t Last Long!</span></p>
				<p>Right now, our group is small enough to manage, and we are adding new contributors all the time!</p>
				<p>But soon, it will be way too big, and the monthly fee will be going up (so we can afford them all), so there&#39;s no guarantee that this $1 free trial offer will be available, or that the monthly fee will stay a low $67 per month after that.</p>  
				<p>Therefore, if you&#39;re teetering on the fence over joining for $1, then sign up now because you don&#39;t want to delay any longer.</p> 
				<p>You&#39;ll get instant access to your free gifts, along with simple instructions for joining our private group on Facebook or streaming off facebook if you choose.</p>  
				<p>The moment we reach our capacity, we will never be able to offer access for only $1 again.</p>
				<p>So if you feel it in your gut, that even one single insight you gain from attending LIVE stream reading with REAL human beings might be worth a single dollar, then you already know what to do.</p>  
				<p>Click the button below, fill out the form on the next page, get your free gifts, join the group, and I&#39;ll see you on the inside.</p>

				<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic; margin-top:0px;">Then only $67/mo, cancel any time</p>
				<p>With Love and Light,</p>
				<p>Crystal Aryana</p>
				<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  Remember: Your first 14 days are totally free, all you pay is $1 in processing so we know you’re a real human being, and not a scammer with a stolen credit card.</p> 
				<p>You get unlimited access to all live events, plus a question answered every week via email. You get all $96 worth of bonuses free, and right away. After 14 days, you&#39;ll pay $67 for your first month if you choose to stay. If you feel like leaving for any reason, you can send us a quick email and cancel anytime.</p>  
				<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> Since you made it this far, I want you to consider this simple fact:</p> 
				<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="subtitle notop">You Can&#39;t Solve A Problem With The Same Thinking It Came From</span></p>
				<p>When you surround yourself with the same low vibration people and situations, you can&#39;t see the forest for the trees, and tapping into your true intuitive power is nearly impossible.</p>  
				<p>In other words, the consciousness you&#39;re operating form that created the issues isn&#39;t the consciousness you need to move ahead.</p>
				<p>You need a fresh new perspective so you can have the breakthroughs you&#39;re looking for and without the same old thinking holding you back.</p>  
				<p>I hate to be a negative nancy, but if you don&#39;t join the Inner Circle you&#39;ll likely stay in the same thinking patterns that have kept you asleep and upset with life.</p>  
				<p>here&#39;s nothing wrong with that, if that&#39;s how you choose to live, but until you decide to do something different, nothing will actually change for you.</p>  
				<p>And for $1, it&#39;s simply not worth the risk to let things stay the same.</p>  
				<p>Join us and let us help you raise your vibration, tap into your spiritual self, and manifest an incredible life. I promise you will love what&#39;s to come.</p>
